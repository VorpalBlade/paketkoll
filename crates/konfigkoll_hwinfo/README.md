# konfigkoll_hwinfo

Hardware information module for `KonfigKoll`

This is a collection of functions that no other library seemed to provide.
You are free to use this, and this follows semver, but it isn't primarily
intended for third party consumption.

Everything here is Linux only and should work without root access.

## MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) policy

The MSRV may be bumped as needed. It is guaranteed that this library will at
least build on the current stable Rust release. An MSRV change is not considered
a breaking change and as such may change even in a patch version.
