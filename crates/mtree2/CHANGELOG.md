## [0.6.0] - 2024-06-28

### Features

- Extract vendored mtree code from paketkoll_core into a new mtree2 library
- Updated dependencies (semver major version)
- [**breaking**] Keep FileMode as numeric, implement support for sticky bit. \
  This is also a performance improvement thanks to reduced size of data structures.
- Resolve escapes in file paths

### Bug fixes

- Fix future-deprecation warning
- Fix compiler warning in mtree2 due to unused code
- Fix clippy warnings

### Performance improvements

- [**breaking**] Unix UID & GID are actually only 32-bit. This is also exposed in Rust standard
  library types, and there is no point in supporting more than that.
- [**breaking**] Optimise type sizes based on which fields are actually present in Arch Linux mtrees.\
  This avoids reserving a lot of space for the uncommon cases.
  Params has gone from 672 bytes to 528 bytes
- Cut temporary allocations by 2/3\
  More than 1 million temporary allocations just went away by using `ok_or_else` instead of `ok_or`!
- Speed up parsing by not using our own hex parser

### Refactoring

- Update to edition 2021
- Fix formatting with "cargo fmt"
- Drop no longer needed newtype_array dependency

## 0.4.1

NOTE: This refers to a release from the previous mtree-rs project that mtree2 is a fork of.
